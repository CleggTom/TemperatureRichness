# Temperature Feasibility
This repository contains code for the paper __"Variation in thermal physiology can drive the temperature-dependence of microbial community richness"__

# Code
contains scripts for simulations with and without assembly as well as analysis of the empirical dataset.

Files are as follows:

`GLV`: folder contains base code to run Lotka-Volterra simualtions in julia.

`Covariance_sims.jl`: Script to run simulations of community richness across temperatures 

`Covariance_assembly_sims.jl`: Script to run simulations of community assembly across temperatures 

`Empirical_sims.jl`: Script to run simulations of communities with the empirical data. 

`fitting_metaanalysis.R`: Script to get empirical data estimates from the meta analysis.
 
# Data
Contains raw data from Smith et al. (2019) and Smith et al. (2020)
